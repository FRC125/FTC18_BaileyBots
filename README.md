## Welcome to Git!

Hi! This is Github, where we store our code, and use version control to collaborate with each other. </br> Here, I will be putting the robot code in bit-by-bit. So that you can learn what it is comprised of in a easy to follow way </br>
I will publish the code with comments so that you can understand what you are looking at. In order to know what code to look at, Look on Slack, or this README (a readme is just a text file that explains what the repository of code is used for).</br>
Let me know if you  have any questions - <i>Unnas</i>

To find the code, go to ```TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/bailey/teamcode``` (sometimes Git will automatically take you to that page).

## 12/14 code to look at
