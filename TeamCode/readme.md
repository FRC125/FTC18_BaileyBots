## Welcome!

This is called a "Git Branch". Basically, in git, you can edit the same file in completely different ways (in different branches) and then merge all the edits later.
This allows developers to work on and test small parts of the code and combine them all once they are all working.

This branch is called "learn". Basically, I will be putting parts of the code, bit by bit. On this branch for you guys to look at so that you aren't overwhelmed or lost with everything going on in the code. Look on the Slack for updates.
Please look at the Classes that I direct you towards, and read the comments. Let me know if there is something I can clarify  -Unnas

###Notes about what you should be looking at right now (12/14)
<li>
    <ul>Subsystems:
        <li>
            <ul>A Susbsytem is a collection of Motors, Sensors, and electronics. For a programmer, this means that the Subsystem is simply an Class with Motor, Sensor, and electronic objects. The subsystem classes also have methods that help run those electronics</ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>BaileyMap and BaileyBot:
        <li>
            <ul>BaileyMap is how the phones know that the code means when we write stuff like "right_motor". Basically, we told the phone that "right_motor" is the motor in Port0. See me if you want to know more about how we do that step </ul>
            <ul>BaileyBot is where we initalize all of the subsystems, and send them their objects. Next, we will go over how we control those subsystems"</ul>
        </li>
